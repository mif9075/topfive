        <h3>Top Five Best Yankees Players</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="./assets/yankees/ruth.jpg">Babe Ruth</a></li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Babe Ruth.</li>
                    <li>Career spanned 22 seasons. 1914-1935. </li>
                    <li>Best player in MLB history.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><a href="./assets/yankees/jeter.jpg">Derek Jeter</a></li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Future Hall of Famer.</li>
                    <li>3,463 hits.</li>
                    <li>14× All-Star (1998–2002, 2004, 2006–2012, 2014).</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><a href="./assets/yankees/gehrig.jpg">Lou Gehrig</a></li>
            <ul>
                    <li>Gehrig batted cleanup, increasing the pressure for pitchers to throw strikes to Ruth. </li>
                    <li>If Gehrig had batted third in the order, with Ruth batting after him, their statistics might be reversed.</li> 
                    <li>Gehrig was a legend. Too bad he is most known for his disease</li>
